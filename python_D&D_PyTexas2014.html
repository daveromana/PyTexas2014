<li>Diversity vs. Inclusion vs. Political Correctness
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Diversity: Lots of different <em>types</em> of people</li>
<li>Political correctness: I hate <code>derogatory term for a group of people</code> but I've been told I can't call them <code>derogatory term</code>. I'm supposed to call them <code>PC term for a group of people</code></li>
<li>Inclusion: Welcoming to all who wish to peacefully co-exist</li>
<li>Python doesn't need more &quot;X&quot; people. Python needs more people who can and will support Python. Those people exist in varied forms.</li>

<h1>Zen of Python</h1>
<p>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</p>
<p>Beautiful is better than ugly. <strong>Explicit is better than implicit.</strong> Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. <em>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</em> <em>Although practicality beats purity.</em> <strong>Errors should never pass silently.</strong> Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <strong>Now is better than never.</strong> <em>Although never is often better than </em>right* now.* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>

<div id="how-to-be-inclusive" class="slide section level1">
<h1>How to be inclusive?</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Check your assumptions
<ul class="incremental">
<li>&quot;You made an assumption you didn't realize you'd made.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>'import this' on Inclusiveness
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Errors pass silently (which Zen of Python does NOT like)
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
<li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
<li>Now is better than never.
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learn to interact with people outside your immediate sphere
<ul class="incremental">
<li>don't just talk to other coders
<ul class="incremental">
<li>non-programmers are the LARGEST growth vector for Python</li>
<li>Python's clean, readable, understandable syntax makes it inviting to &quot;non-programmers&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Anna Ravenscroft, at about 50 minutes, suggests you &quot;bring someone who is NOT like you&quot; to the next EuroPython (or Python conference).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ignore legal requirements
<ul class="incremental">
<li>no one wants to feel &quot;forced&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider the feelings of others</li>
<li>Practice inclusivity in your local Python community</li>
<li>Have a wider range of people at your local Python events</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-if-you-cant" class="slide section level1">
<h1>What if you can't?</h1>
<p>If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's &quot;too hard&quot;, be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.</p>

<div id="final-words" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Final Words</h1>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/514104755660914688">Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort.</a></p>
<p>That goes for people too, especially <strong>me</strong>. It's a process/journey, not a product/destination.</p>
